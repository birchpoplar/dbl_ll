# Doubly Linked List in C

Implemented:
- insert first
- insert last
- display forward
- display backward
- delete (based on key)
- find
- substitute

To do:
- insert after key
- delete entire list

Note: very little error checking or failsafes implemented. e.g. mostly assumes any key given is in the linked list.
